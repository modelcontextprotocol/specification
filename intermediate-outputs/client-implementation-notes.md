# MCP TypeScript SDK Test Client Implementation Notes

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive test client for the MCP TypeScript SDK compliance tests that executes 25 different scenarios defined in `compliance/scenarios/data.json`.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. CLI Interface
- Used Commander.js for robust CLI argument parsing
- Supports all required arguments: `--scenario-id`, `--id`, and transport specification
- Flexible transport argument parsing to support stdio, SSE, and streamable-http

### 2. Transport Support
- **stdio**: Fully implemented using `StdioClientTransport` from the SDK
- **SSE**: Fully implemented using `SSEClientTransport` from the SDK
- **streamable-http**: Not yet available in the SDK - throws informative error

### 3. Scenario Execution
- Each scenario has a dedicated execution function for clarity
- Scenarios are dispatched based on ID using a switch statement
- Common scenarios (like basic add) are reused across transport-specific tests

### 4. Type Safety
- Used Zod for runtime validation of scenarios data
- Leveraged TypeScript types from the SDK for all MCP operations
- Created local type definitions matching the compliance test types

### 5. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate exit codes
- Validation errors for missing scenarios, invalid client IDs, etc.
- Try-catch blocks around async operations with proper cleanup

## Implementation Highlights

### Elicitation Handling
- Set up event listener for elicitation events
- Smart response logic based on scenario description
- Default behavior is to decline elicitations

### Multi-Client Scenarios
- Client ID awareness in scenario execution
- Different behavior based on whether client is "client1" or "client2"
- Timing considerations for synchronization between clients

### Resource Subscriptions
- Proper event handling for resource updates
- Timeout mechanisms to prevent hanging tests
- Promise-based waiting for notifications

### Progress and Notifications
- Event listeners for progress updates
- Handling of various notification types (tools changed, roots changed, etc.)
- Warning messages for expected but optional notifications

## Limitations and TODOs

1. **Streamable HTTP Transport**: Not yet available in the SDK
2. **Cancellation**: The SDK may not fully support operation cancellation yet
3. **Text Completion**: Not a standard SDK feature - logged as not implemented
4. **Sampling**: The implementation assumes the server will handle sampling internally

## Testing Considerations

- The client expects exact response formats from the server
- Timing-sensitive scenarios may need adjustment based on actual server behavior
- Some scenarios require specific server-side state management (e.g., per-client trig functions)

## Usage Example

```bash
./test-client --scenario-id 1 --id client1 stdio ./test-server --server-name CalcServer --transport stdio
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement unit tests for the client
2. Add more robust error handling for edge cases
3. Implement streamable-http transport when available in SDK
4. Add retry logic for flaky network operations
5. Enhance logging for debugging failed scenarios
