# Contributing to Model Context Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Model Context Protocol specification!
This document outlines how to contribute to this project.

## Prerequisites

The following software is required to work on the spec:

- Node.js 20 or above
- TypeScript
- TypeScript JSON Schema (for generating JSON schema)
- [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) (optional, for docs)
- nvm (optional, for managing Node versions)

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/modelcontextprotocol.git
cd modelcontextprotocol
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
nvm install  # install correct Node version
npm install  # install dependencies
```

## Making Changes

Note that schema changes are made to `schema.ts`, and `schema.json` is generated from
`schema.ts`.

1. Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes.

3. Validate schema changes and generate `schema.json`:

```bash
npm run check:schema:ts
npm run generate:json
```

4. Validate documentation changes and apply formatting:

```bash
npm run check:docs
npm run format
```

5. Preview documentation locally (optional):

```bash
npm run serve:docs
```

### Documentation Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation:

- Keep content clear, concise, and technically accurate
- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Use proper MDX formatting and components
- Test all links and code samples
  - You may run `npm run check:docs:links` to look for broken internal links.
- Use appropriate headings: "When to use", "Steps", and "Tips" for tutorials
- Place new pages in appropriate sections (concepts, tutorials, etc.)
- Update `docs.json` when adding new pages
- Follow existing file naming conventions (`kebab-case.mdx`)
- Include proper frontmatter in MDX files

### Specification Proposal Guidelines

#### Principles of MCP

1. **Simple + Minimal**: It is much easier to add things to a specification than it is to
   remove them. To maintain simplicity, we keep a high bar for adding new concepts and
   primitives as each addition requires maintenance and compatibility consideration.
2. **Concrete**: Specification changes need to be based on specific implementation
   challenges and not on speculative ideas.

### Stages of a specification proposal

1. **Define**: Explore the problem space, validate that other MCP users face a similar
   issue, and then clearly define the problem.
2. **Prototype**: Build an example solution to the problem and demonstrate its practical
   application.
3. **Write**: Based on the prototype, write a specification proposal.

## Submitting Changes
