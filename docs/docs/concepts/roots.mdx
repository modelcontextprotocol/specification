Roots are a concept in MCP that define the boundaries where servers can operate. They provide a way for clients to inform servers about relevant filesystem resources and their locations.

## What are Roots?

A root is a file URI that a client suggests a server should focus on. When a client connects to a server, it declares which roots the server should work with. Roots must be valid file URIs.

For example, roots could be `file:///home/user/projects/myapp`.

## Why Use Roots?

Roots serve several important purposes:

1. **Guidance**: They inform servers about relevant filesystem resources and locations
2. **Clarity**: Roots make it clear which resources are part of your workspace
3. **Organization**: Multiple roots let you work with different filesystem resources simultaneously

## How Roots Work

When a client supports roots, it:

1. Declares the `roots` capability during connection
2. Provides a list of suggested roots to the server
3. Notifies the server when roots change (if supported)

While roots are informational and not strictly enforcing, servers should:

1. Respect the provided roots
2. Use root URIs to locate and access filesystem resources
3. Prioritize operations within root boundaries

## Common Use Cases

Roots are commonly used to define:

- Project directories
- Repository locations
- Configuration locations
- Resource boundaries

## Best Practices

When working with roots:

1. Only suggest necessary filesystem resources
2. Use clear, descriptive names for roots
3. Monitor root accessibility
4. Handle root changes gracefully

## Example

Here's how a typical MCP client might expose roots:

```json
{
  "roots": [
    {
      "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/frontend",
      "name": "Frontend Repository"
    },
    {
      "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/backend",
      "name": "Backend Repository"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration suggests the server focus on two local repositories while keeping them logically separated.
