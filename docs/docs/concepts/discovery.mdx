title: Server Discovery
description: Automatic discovery of MCP servers via well-known metadata
---

## Overview

Server discovery enables MCP clients to automatically detect and connect to MCP servers when users provide URLs from domains that host MCP-enabled services. This mechanism streamlines the user experience by eliminating manual configuration.

## How it works

MCP servers can advertise their presence by hosting a metadata file at `/.well-known/mcp.json` on their domain. When a client encounters a URL, it can check for this file to determine if an MCP server with an HTTP endpoint is available.

This discovery mechanism is specifically designed for web-based MCP servers and does not apply to stdio-based servers.

    User->>Client: Provides URL (e.g., example.com/doc/123)
    Client->>Server: GET /.well-known/mcp.json
    Server-->>Client: Returns server metadata
    Client->>User: "MCP server available. Connect?"
    User->>Client: Approves connection
    Client->>Server: Establishes MCP connection
```

## Metadata format

The well-known file provides essential information about the server:

```json
{
  "name": "Example",
  "description": "Access and manage Example.com resources through MCP",
  "icon": "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/mcp"
}
```

## Benefits

**For users:**

- Seamless discovery of MCP-enabled services
- No manual configuration required
- Clear information about server capabilities

**For developers:**

- Standard way to advertise MCP capabilities
- Simplified onboarding for users
- Consistent discovery across all MCP clients

## Security considerations

- Well-known files must be served over HTTPS
- Clients should validate metadata before connecting
- Users should explicitly approve new connections
- Servers should implement appropriate CORS policies

## Implementation

For detailed implementation guidelines, see the [Server Discovery specification](/specification/draft/server/discovery).
