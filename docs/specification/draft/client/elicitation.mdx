<div id="enable-section-numbers" />

<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>

<Note>

The design of the Elicitation capability may evolve in future protocol versions.

</Note>

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to request additional
information from users through the client during interactions. This flow allows clients to
maintain control over user interactions and data sharing while enabling servers to gather
necessary information dynamically.

Elicitation supports two modes:

- **Form mode** (in-band): Servers can request structured data from users with optional JSON schemas to validate responses
- **Out-of-band mode**: Servers can direct users to external URLs for sensitive interactions that must _not_ pass through the MCP client

## User Interaction Model

Elicitation in MCP allows servers to implement interactive workflows by enabling user input
requests to occur _nested_ inside other MCP server features.

Implementations are free to expose elicitation through any interface pattern that suits
their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction
model.

<Warning>

For trust & safety and security:

- Servers **MUST NOT** use form mode elicitation to request sensitive information
- Servers **MUST** use out-of-band mode for interactions involving sensitive information, such as credentials
- URLs **MUST NOT** appear in any field of an elicitation request, other than the `url` field in an out-of-band mode request

Applications **SHOULD**:

- Provide UI that makes it clear which server is requesting information
- For out-of-band mode, clearly display the target domain/host before navigation
- Allow users to review and modify their responses before sending
- Respect user privacy and provide clear reject and cancel options

</Warning>

## Capabilities

Clients that support elicitation **MUST** declare the `elicitation` capability during
[initialization](/specification/draft/basic/lifecycle#initialization):

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "elicitation": {
      "form": {},
      "oob": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Clients declaring the `elicitation` capability **MUST** support at least one mode (`form` or `oob`).

Servers **MUST NOT** send elicitation requests with modes that are not supported by the client.

## Protocol Messages

### Elicitation Requests

To request information from a user, servers send an `elicitation/create` request.

All elicitation requests **MUST** include the following parameters:

| Name      | Type   | Options       | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mode`    | string | `form`, `oob` | The mode of the elicitation.                                       |
| `message` | string |               | A human-readable message explaining why the interaction is needed. |

The `mode` parameter specifies the type of elicitation:

- `"form"`: In-band structured data collection with optional schema validation. Data is exposed to the client.
- `"oob"`: Out-of-band interaction via URL navigation. Data is **not** exposed to the client.

### Form Elicitation Requests

Form elicitation allows servers to collect structured data directly through the MCP client.

Form elicitation requests **MUST** specify `mode: "form"` and include these parameters:

| Name              | Type   | Description                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requestedSchema` | object | A JSON Schema defining the structure of the expected response. |

#### Requested Schema

The `requestedSchema` parameter allows servers to define the structure of the expected
response using a restricted subset of JSON Schema.

To simplify implementation for clients, elicitation schemas are limited to flat objects
with primitive properties only.

The schema is restricted to these primitive types:

1. **String Schema**

   ```json
   {
     "type": "string",
     "title": "Display Name",
     "description": "Description text",
     "minLength": 3,
     "maxLength": 50,
     "pattern": "^[A-Za-z]+$",
     "format": "email"
   }
   ```

   Supported formats: `email`, `uri`, `date`, `date-time`

2. **Number Schema**

   ```json
   {
     "type": "number", // or "integer"
     "title": "Display Name",
     "description": "Description text",
     "minimum": 0,
     "maximum": 100
   }
   ```

3. **Boolean Schema**

   ```json
   {
     "type": "boolean",
     "title": "Display Name",
     "description": "Description text",
     "default": false
   }
   ```

4. **Enum Schema**
   ```json
   {
     "type": "string",
     "title": "Display Name",
     "description": "Description text",
     "enum": ["option1", "option2", "option3"],
     "enumNames": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
   }
   ```

Clients can use this schema to:

1. Generate appropriate input forms
2. Validate user input before sending
3. Provide better guidance to users

Note that complex nested structures, arrays of objects, and other advanced JSON Schema features are intentionally not supported to simplify client implementation.

#### Example: Simple Text Request

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "elicitation/create",
  "params": {
    "mode": "form",
    "message": "Please provide your GitHub username",
    "requestedSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": ["name"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "action": "accept",
    "content": {
      "name": "octocat"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example: Structured Data Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "elicitation/create",
  "params": {
    "mode": "form",
    "message": "Please provide your contact information",
    "requestedSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Your full name"
        },
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "description": "Your email address"
        },
        "age": {
          "type": "number",
          "minimum": 18,
          "description": "Your age"
        }
      },
      "required": ["name", "email"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "action": "accept",
    "content": {
      "name": "Monalisa Octocat",
      "email": "octocat@github.com",
      "age": 30
    }
  }
}
```

### Out-of-Band Elicitation Requests

Out-of-band elicitation enables servers to direct users to external URLs for interactions that must not pass through the MCP client. This is essential for auth flows, payment processing, and other sensitive or secure operations.

<Note>
  **Important**: Out-of-band elicitation is *not* for re-authorizing the MCP
  client's access to the MCP server (that is covered by [MCP
  authorization](../basic/authorization)). It's specifically for scenarios where
  the MCP server needs to obtain sensitive information, or authorization for
  third-party services on behalf of the user. The MCP client's authorization
  (bearer) token remains unchanged throughout this process.
</Note>

Out-of-band elicitation requests **MUST** specify `mode: "oob"` and include these parameters:

| Name            | Type   | Description                               |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `url`           | string | The URL that the user should navigate to. |
| `elicitationId` | string | A unique identifier for the elicitation.  |

The `url` parameter **MUST** contain a valid URL. The `message` parameter **MUST NOT** contain a URL.

#### Example: Request Sensitive Data

This example shows an out-of-band elicitation request directing the user to a secure URL where they can provide sensitive information (an API key, for example).
The same request could direct the user into an OAuth authorization flow, or a payment flow. The only difference is the URL and the message.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "elicitation/create",
  "params": {
    "mode": "oob",
    "elicitationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "url": "https://mcp.example.com/ui/set_api_key",
    "message": "Please provide your API key to continue."
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": {
    "action": "accept"
  }
}
```

The response with `action: "accept"` indicates that the user has consented to the
interaction. It does not mean that the interaction is complete. The interaction occurs out
of band and the client is not aware of the outcome, unless the client requests progress updates.

### Progress Tracking

The client **MAY** request progress updates from the server by sending an `elicitation/track` request with a [progress token](/specification/draft/basic/utilities/progress#progress-token). This is particularly useful in out-of-band mode, because the client is not involved in the interaction.

The client **MUST** include an `elicitationId` in the request to identify which elicitation to send progress updates for. The client **SHOULD** include a `progressToken` in the request's `_meta` field.

The server **MUST** ignore any `elicitation/track` requests containing an `elicitationId` that is not known or does not belong to the client.

The server **MAY** send a `notifications/progress` notification to the client with the progress token and the progress status.

The server **SHOULD** send a `elicitation/track` response to the client once the elicitation is complete.

#### Example

**Progress Tracking Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 4,
  "method": "elicitation/track",
  "params": {
    "_meta": {
      "progressToken": "abc123"
    },
    "elicitationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  }
}
```

**Progress Tracking Notification:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "abc123",
    "progress": 42,
    "message": "Consent pending..."
  }
}
```

**Progress Tracking Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 4,
  "result": {
    "status": "complete"
  }
}
```

### Elicitation Required Error

When another request cannot be processed until an elicitation is completed, the server **SHOULD** return an [ElicitationRequired error](/docs/concepts/architecture#error-handling) (code `-32604`) to indicate to the client that an elicitation is required.

The error **MUST** include a list of elicitations that are required to complete before the original can be retried.

Any elicitations returned in the error **MUST** be out-of-band mode elicitations and have an `elicitationId` property.
Servers that want elicit data from the user via form mode **SHOULD** make a separate elicitation request for each form mode elicitation.

**Error Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "error": {
    "code": -32604, // ELICITATION_REQUIRED
    "message": "This request requires more information.",
    "data": {
      "elicitations": [
        {
          "mode": "oob",
          "elicitionId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
          "url": "https://oauth.example.com/authorize?client_id=abc123&response_type=code&...",
          "message": "Authorization is required to access your Example Co files."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Message Flow

### Form Mode Flow

```mermaid

    Note over Server,Client: Complete request
    Client->>Server: Return user response

    Note over Server: Continue processing with new information
```

### Out-of-Band Mode Flow

    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Server: Server initiates elicitation

    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: tools/call

    Note over Server: Server needs authorization
    Server->>Client: ElicitationRequired error
    Note over Client: Client notes the original request can be retried after elicitation

    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL
    User-->>Client: Provide consent

    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL
    Client->>Server: Accept response
    Client-->>Server: elicitation/track request (optional)

    Note over User,UserAgent: User interaction

    UserAgent-->>Server: Interaction complete
    Server-->>Client: elicitation/track response (optional)

    Client->>Server: Retry tools/call (optional)
```

## Response Actions

Elicitation responses use a three-action model to clearly distinguish between different user actions. These actions apply to both form and out-of-band elicitation modes.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "action": "accept", // or "reject" or "cancel"
    "content": {
      "propertyName": "value",
      "anotherProperty": 42
    }
  }
}
```

The three response actions are:

1. **Accept** (`action: "accept"`): User explicitly approved and submitted with data

   - For form mode: The `content` field contains the submitted data matching the requested schema
   - For out-of-band mode: The `content` field is omitted
   - Example: User clicked "Submit", "OK", "Confirm", etc.

2. **Reject** (`action: "reject"`): User explicitly rejected the request

   - The `content` field is typically omitted
   - Example: User clicked "Reject", "Decline", "No", etc.

3. **Cancel** (`action: "cancel"`): User dismissed without making an explicit choice
   - The `content` field is typically omitted
   - Example: User closed the dialog, clicked outside, pressed Escape, etc.

Servers should handle each state appropriately:

- **Accept**: Process the submitted data or proceed with the interaction
- **Decline**: Handle explicit rejection (e.g., offer alternatives)
- **Cancel**: Handle dismissal (e.g., prompt again later)

## Implementation Considerations

### Statefulness

Most practical uses of elicitation require that the server maintain state about users:

- Whether required information has been collected (e.g., the user's display name via form elicitation)
- Status of resource access (e.g., API keys or a payment flow via out-of-band elicitation)

Servers implementing elicitation **MUST** securely associate this state with individual users following the guidelines in the [security best practices](../basic/security_best_practices) document. Specifically:

- State **MUST NOT** be associated with session IDs alone
- User identification **MUST** be derived from authenticated tokens
- State storage **MUST** be protected against unauthorized access

<Note>
  The examples in this section are non-normative and illustrate potential uses
  of elicitation. Implementers should adapt these patterns to their specific
  requirements while maintaining security best practices.
</Note>

### Out-of-Band Elicitation for Sensitive Data

For servers that interact with APIs requiring sensitive credentials (e.g. LLM APIs), out-of-band elicitation provides a secure mechanism for collecting API keys without exposing them to the MCP client or host application.

In this pattern:

1. The server directs users to a secure web page (served over HTTPS)
2. The page presents a branded form UI on a domain the user trusts
3. Users enter sensitive credentials directly into the secure form
4. The server stores credentials securely, bound to the user's identity
5. Subsequent MCP requests use these stored credentials for API access

This approach ensures that sensitive credentials never pass through the MCP client or any intermediate MCP servers, reducing the risk of exposure through client-side logging or other attack vectors.

### Out-of-Band Elicitation for OAuth Flows

Out-of-band elicitation enables a pattern where MCP servers act as OAuth clients to third-party resource servers.
The "downstream authorization" enabled by out-of-band elicitation is fundamentally separate from [MCP authorization](../basic/authorization).

<Note>
  This distinction is critical to understand. Out-of-band elicitation is *not*
  about authorizing (or re-authorizing) the MCP client to access the MCP server.
  It *can* be used to enable the MCP server to access third-party resources or
  APIs on behalf of the user, without exposing sensitive credentials or tokens
  to the MCP client.
</Note>

#### Understanding the Distinction

- **MCP Authorization**: Required OAuth flow between the MCP client and MCP server (covered in the [authorization specification](../basic/authorization))
- **Downstream Authorization**: Optional OAuth flow between the MCP server and a third-party resource server, initiated via out-of-band elicitation

In downstream authorization, the server acts as both:

- An OAuth resource server (to the MCP client)
- An OAuth client (to the third-party resource server)

Consider this hypothetical scenario:

- Claude Desktop (the MCP client) connects to Bob's Productivity Server (an HTTPS MCP server)
- Bob's Productivity Server integrates with Dropbox and Google APIs
- When Claude calls a tool that requires Dropbox access, the MCP server needs Dropbox credentials

The critical security requirements are:

1. **The Dropbox token MUST NOT transit through Claude Desktop**: The client must never see third-party credentials
2. **The MCP server MUST NOT use its Claude access token for Dropbox**: That would be [token passthrough](../basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough), which is forbidden
3. **The user must authorize the MCP server directly**: The interaction happens outside the MCP protocol

The tokens from these flows are never mixed or passed through. The MCP client's token is for the MCP server only, and the third-party tokens never leave the MCP server.

<Note>
  For more background, read the [token passthrough
  section](../basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) of the Security
  Best Practices document to understand why MCP servers cannot act as
  pass-through proxies.
</Note>

#### Implementation Pattern

When implementing downstream authorization via out-of-band elicitation:

1. The MCP server generates an authorization URL, acting as an OAuth client to the third-party service
2. The server creates an out-of-band elicitation request with this URL
3. The user completes the OAuth flow directly with the third-party authorization server
4. The third-party authorization server redirects back to the MCP server
5. The MCP server securely stores the third-party tokens, bound to the user's identity
6. Future MCP requests can leverage these stored tokens for API access to the third-party resource server

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UserAgent as User Agent (Browser)
    participant 3AS as 3rd Party AS
    participant 3RS as 3rd Party RS
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Server as MCP Server

    Client->>Server: tools/call
    Note over Server: Needs 3rd-party authorization for user
    Note over Server: Store state (which user this auth flow is for)
    Server->>Client: ElicitationRequired error<br> (mode: "oob", url: "example.com/authorize?...")
    Note over Client: Client notes the tools/call request can be retried later
    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL
    User->>Client: Provide consent
    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL
    Client->>Server: Accept response
    Client-->>Server: elicitation/track request (optional)
    UserAgent->>3AS: Load authorize route
    Note over 3AS,User: User interaction (OAuth flow):<br>User consents to scoped MCP Server access
    3AS->>UserAgent: redirect to MCP Server's redirect_uri
    UserAgent->>Server: load redirect_uri page
    Note over Server: Confirm: redirect_uri belongs to MCP Server
    Note over Server: Confirm: elicitation matches user session<br>Confirm: user is logged into MCP Server or MCP AS
    Server->>3AS: Exchange authorization code for  OAuth tokens
    3AS->>Server: Grants tokens
    Note over Server: Bind tokens to MCP user identity
    Server-->>Client: elicitation/track response (optional)
    Client->>Server: Retry tools/call
    Note over Server: Retrieve token bound to user identity
    Server->>3RS: Call 3rd-party API
```

This pattern maintains clear security boundaries while enabling rich integrations with third-party services that require user authorization.

## Security Considerations

1. Clients **MUST** provide clear indication of which server is requesting information
2. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls
3. Clients **SHOULD** allow users to reject elicitation requests at any time
4. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting
5. Clients **SHOULD** present elicitation requests in a way that makes it clear what information is being requested and why
6. Servers **MUST** bind elicitation requests to the user's identity

### Safe URL Handling

Clients implementing out-of-band elicitation **MUST** handle URLs carefully to prevent users from unknowingly clicking malicious links.

1. Servers **MUST NOT** include URLs in any message or schema fields as part of a form elicitation request.
2. Servers **MUST NOT** include URLs in any message or schema fields as part of an out-of-band elicitation request, except for the `url` field.

These requirements ensure that client implementations have clear rules about when to present a URL to the user, so that other rules about user consent and SSRF protection (below) can be consistently applied.

### Identifying the User

Servers **MUST NOT** rely on client-provided user identification, as this can be forged.
Instead, servers **SHOULD** follow [security best practices](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices).

Non-normative examples:

- Incorrect: Treat user input like "I am joe@example.com" as authoritative
- Correct: Rely on the [MCP authorization server](/specification/draft/basic/authorization) to identify the user

### Form Mode Security

1. Servers **MUST NOT** request sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) via form mode
2. Clients **SHOULD** validate all responses against the provided schema
3. Servers **SHOULD** validate received data matches the requested schema

### Out-of-Band Mode Security

Clients **MUST NOT** open a user agent (e.g. browser) without explicit consent from the user

#### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Since clients facilitate the opening of URLs provided by servers, they **MUST** implement SSRF protections, including:

- Requiring the `https://` scheme for all out-of-band URLs (no HTTP, `file://`, etc.)
- Blocking requests to internal IP ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.0/8`, etc.)
- Clearly rendering or distinguishing Unicode characters (e.g. punycode URLs) to avoid "look-alike" misdirections
- Clearly communicating the destination server and target URL to the user when asking for consent

Further recommendations can be found in the OWASP [SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).

#### Phishing

Out-of-band elicitation returns a URL that an attacker can use to send to a victim. The MCP Server **MUST** verify the identity of the user who opens the URL before accepting information.

Typically identity verification is done by leveraging the [MCP authorization server](/specification/draft/basic/authorization) to identify the user, through a session cookie or equivalent in the browser.

For example, out-of-band elicitation may be used to perform OAuth flows where the server acts as an OAuth client of another resource server. Without proper mitigation, the following phishing attack is possible:

1. A malicious user (Alice) connected to a benign server triggers an elicitation request
2. The benign server generates an authorization URL, acting as an OAuth client of a third-party authorization server
3. Alice's client displays the URL and asks for consent
4. Instead of clicking on the link, Alice tricks a victim user (Bob) of the same benign server into clicking it
5. Bob opens the link and completes the authorization, thinking they are authorizing their own connection to the benign server
6. The benign server receives a callback/redirect form the third-party authorization server, and assumes it's Alice's request
7. The tokens for the third-party server are bound to Alice's session and identity, instead of Bob's, resulting in an account takeover

To prevent this attack, the server **MUST** check the identity of the user (step 6 in the above example), and confirm that the user who is completing the authorization is the same user who initiated the elicitation request.
