<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>

The Model Context Protocol consists of several key components that work together:

- **Base Protocol**: Core JSON-RPC message types
- **Lifecycle Management**: Connection initialization, capability negotiation, and
  session control
- **Authorization**: Authentication and authorization framework for HTTP-based transports
- **Server Features**: Resources, prompts, and tools exposed by servers
- **Client Features**: Sampling and root directory lists provided by clients
- **Utilities**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging and argument completion

All implementations **MUST** support the base protocol and lifecycle management
components. Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the
application.

These protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich
interactions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to
support exactly the features they need.

## Messages

All messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the
[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines
these types of messages:

### Requests

Requests are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, to initiate an operation.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string | number;
  method: string;
  params?: {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
}
```

- Requests **MUST** include a string or integer ID.
- Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`.
- The request ID **MUST NOT** have been previously used by the requestor within the same
  session.

### Responses

Responses are sent in reply to requests, containing the result or error of the operation.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string | number;
  result?: {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  }
  error?: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    data?: unknown;
  }
}
```

- Responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to.
- **Responses** are further sub-categorized as either **successful results** or
  **errors**. Either a `result` or an `error` **MUST** be set. A response **MUST NOT**
  set both.
- Results **MAY** follow any JSON object structure, while errors **MUST** include an
  error code and message at minimum.
- Error codes **MUST** be integers.

### Notifications

Notifications are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, as a one-way message.
The receiver **MUST NOT** send a response.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: string;
  params?: {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
}
```

- Notifications **MUST NOT** include an ID.

## Auth

MCP provides an [Authorization](/specification/draft/basic/authorization) framework for use with HTTP.
Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification,
whereas implementations using STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification,
and instead retrieve credentials from the environment.

Additionally, clients and servers **MAY** negotiate their own custom authentication and
authorization strategies.

## Schema

The full specification of the protocol is defined as a
[TypeScript schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.ts).
This is the source of truth for all protocol messages and structures.

There is also a
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.json),
which is automatically generated from the TypeScript source of truth, for use with
various automated tooling.

## JSON Schema Usage

The Model Context Protocol uses JSON Schema for validation throughout the protocol. This section clarifies how JSON Schema should be used within MCP messages.

### Schema Dialect

MCP supports JSON Schema with the following rules:

1. **Default dialect**: When a schema does not include a `$schema` field, it defaults to JSON Schema 2020-12 (`https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema`)
2. **Explicit dialect**: Schemas MAY include a `$schema` field to specify a different dialect
3. **Supported dialects**: Implementations MUST support at least 2020-12 and SHOULD document which additional dialects they support

### Example Usage

#### Default dialect (2020-12):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "age": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0 }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

#### Explicit dialect (draft-07):

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "age": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0 }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

- Clients and servers **MUST** support JSON Schema 2020-12 for schemas without an explicit `$schema` field
- Clients and servers **SHOULD** validate schemas according to their declared or default dialect
- Clients and servers **SHOULD** handle schemas with unsupported dialects gracefully by either:
  - Supporting the requested dialect
  - Returning an appropriate error indicating the dialect is not supported
  - Documenting which dialects they support

### Schema Validation

- Schemas **MUST** be valid according to their declared or default dialect
- The `inputSchema` field **MUST NOT** be `null` - for tools with no parameters, use one of these valid approaches:

  - `true` - accepts any input (most permissive)
  - `{}` - equivalent to `true`, accepts any input
  - `{"type": "object"}` - accepts any object
  - `{"type": "object", "additionalProperties": false}` - accepts only empty objects

  Example for a tool with no parameters:

  ```json
  {
    "inputSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "description": "This tool requires no parameters"
    }
  }
  ```

- Schema properties **MUST NOT** contain `null` values as this is invalid in all JSON Schema versions

## General fields

### `_meta`

The `_meta` property/parameter is reserved by MCP to allow clients and servers
to attach additional metadata to their interactions.

Certain key names are reserved by MCP for protocol-level metadata, as specified below;
implementations MUST NOT make assumptions about values at these keys.

Additionally, definitions in the [schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.ts)
may reserve particular names for purpose-specific metadata, as declared in those definitions.

**Key name format:** valid `_meta` key names have two segments: an optional **prefix**, and a **name**.

**Prefix:**

- If specified, MUST be a series of labels separated by dots (`.`), followed by a slash (`/`).
  - Labels MUST start with a letter and end with a letter or digit; interior characters can be letters, digits, or hyphens (`-`).
- Any prefix beginning with zero or more valid labels, followed by `modelcontextprotocol` or `mcp`, followed by any valid label,
  is **reserved** for MCP use.
  - For example: `modelcontextprotocol.io/`, `mcp.dev/`, `api.modelcontextprotocol.org/`, and `tools.mcp.com/` are all reserved.

**Name:**

- Unless empty, MUST begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`).
- MAY contain hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics in between.
